Commune
=======

Commune is a peer-to-peer file transfer protocol, created for 
[Carleton College](http://www.carleton.edu/)'s Computer Networks course.

This repository contains the reference implementation of the Commune protocol.
Commune has a full [protocol specification][spec], written in the style of
RFC's. The protocol is extendable; peers indicate the set of optional protocol
facilities they support in their User-Agent string, which is sent during
the protocol's handshake and retransmitted by its peer exchange mechanism.

The reference implementation attempts to be a modern Java application. It uses
the `java.nio` package to serve an arbitrary number of connections from a
single thread. Running it requires Java 1.5 or newer.

The implementation code is organized into a number of packages:

  - `commune.net`: low-level code for performing asynchronous networking
  - `commune.protocol`: classes that encode the protocol's messages, and who
    know how to create and unpack their binary representations to and from
    buffers
  - `commune.source`: classes and interfaces for locating and making available
    resources to other peers
  - `commune.peer`: all the business logic of implementing the protocol.

Running Commune
---------------

To run the reference implementation, first compile it by executing `make` or
running `javac commune/Commune.java` from the main directory.

After that, run `java commune.Commune`. An interactive prompt will be
presented; type `help` for a list of available commands.
